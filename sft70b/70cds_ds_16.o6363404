[default3]:The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).

Packing flattens batches into a single sequence, and Flash Attention is the only known attention mechanisms that reliably support this. Using other implementations may lead to cross-contamination between batches. To avoid this, either disable packing by setting `packing=False`, or set `attn_implementation='flash_attention_2'` or `attn_implementation='kernels-community/vllm-flash-attn3'` in the model configuration.
